# _______________________________________

I finally made it and finished recovering The Europa Arcology Incident. 
The game is done by Markus Persson Notch, you have the original readme from him in the folder.
I will not upload the source, i didn't spot any source from notch and im not sure if he did back then.

Also you have the original jar here, it was the applet one, no way it works on
modern browsers ;)**
